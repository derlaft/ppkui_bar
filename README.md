ppkui_bar is a native wayland client for providing a bottom touch bar.

## Usage

```bash
ppkui_bar --config bar.toml
```

#### Features

* Using a custom font generated by [glyphter](https://glyphter.com/).
* Wayland layer-shell protocol support.
* Configuration file.
* Touch and pointer event handling.
* Command execution.

Several features have not yet been implemented:

* Using a virtual keyboard protocol to emulate keystrokes instead of command execution (may be a bit faster and efficient).
* Multitouch handling?
* Packaging for some distros.

Overall it is quite rough around the edges at this point, although it is usable.
