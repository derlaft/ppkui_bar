pepekroll-bar is a native wayland client for providing a bottom touch bar.

## Usage

```bash
pepekroll-bar -- \
  -b 'â®¹' 'echo B1' \
  -b 'ðŸ¡„' 'echo B2' \
  -b 'ðŸ¡†' 'echo B3' \
  -b 'âŒ¨' 'echo B4' \
  --height 64
```

#### Missing features

Several features have not yet been implemented:

* Configuration and theming
* Testing on a real pinephone

Overall it is quite rough around the edges at this point, although it is usable.
